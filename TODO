 - [DONE] add parameters in C++ (child class from ParameterizedEntity)
 - improve dataproxy registration and creation in DataManager (too heavy process yet)
verify that the dataSource type is defined when bounding. 
 - check the DataProxy creation process to compute a proxy name
 - add interface in python
 - check if modification is needed for graphviz
 - check if modification is needed regarding config files
 - sample proxies:
   * delay
   * offset/scale integer
   * offset/scale float
   * mask change value
   * other... ?
