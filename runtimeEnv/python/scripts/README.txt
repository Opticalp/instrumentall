This folder contains the scripts that should be launched by InstrumentAll. 

They are different types of scripts :
 * initScripts that are launched at InstrumentAll initialization to build a workflow/dataflow for example,
 * scripts that can be launched as main processing logic, from the command line, as property file entry, or as GUI-script (in a loop or once).
