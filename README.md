# InstrumentAll

Wide-purpose instrumentation software

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Opticalp/instrumentall.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Opticalp/instrumentall) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/eeyuwnu5wc7uotng/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Opticalp/instrumentall/branch/develop)

InstrumentAll's goal is to provide a flexible framework allowing to control various hardwares (cameras, lightings, motion controllers, ...) while processing data very efficiently using multi-threading. 

The dataflow is not sequencial: a data input trigs an action. 

# Work in progress

The current effort consists in remastering the actual Instrumentall development version (private SVN) while bringing it to GitHub. 
This work includes deep cleaning of the code and Continuous Integration management. 

*Development status: release candidate for 2.0*
