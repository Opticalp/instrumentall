# InstrumentAll

Wide-purpose instrumentation software

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Opticalp/instrumentall.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Opticalp/instrumentall) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/eeyuwnu5wc7uotng/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Opticalp/instrumentall/branch/develop)

InstrumentAll's goal is to provide a flexible framework allowing to control various hardwares (cameras, lightings, motion controllers, ...) while processing data very efficiently using multi-threading. 

The dataflow is not sequencial: a data input trigs an action. 

# Work in progress

The remastering of InstrumentAll v1.0 (private SVN) is almost fully achieved with the released [v2.0](0814da7). 
Some work has still to be done to automatize the development process (changelog, version incrementation, static code check). 

*Development status: 2.0*
